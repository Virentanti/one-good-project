Assertion             :       Fuse wire must have high resistance and low melting point. Reason                 :   Fuse is used for small current flow only.
A)             If both assertion and reason are true and the reason is the correct explanation of the assertion.
B)             If both assertion and reason are true but reason is not the correct explanation of the assertion.

D)             If the assertion and reason both are false.
E)             If assertion is false but reason is true.
Correct Answer: C
Solution :
            Assertion is true but reason is false. Fuse wire must have high resistance because in series current remains same, therefore according to Joule's law
, heat produced is high if R is high. The melting point must be low so that wire may melt with increase in temperature. As the current equal to maximum safe value, flows through the fuse wire, it heats up, melts and break the circuit.

Assertion             :       Two electric bulbs of 50 and 100 W are given. When connected in series 50 W bulb glows more but when connected parallel 100 W bulb glows more.  Reason                 :   In series combination, power is directly proportional to the resistance of circuit. But in parallel combination, power is inversely proportional to the resistance of the circuit.
A)             If both assertion and reason are true and the reason is the correct explanation of the assertion.
B)             If both assertion and reason are true but reason is not the correct explanation of the assertion.

D)             If the assertion and reason both are false.
E)             If assertion is false but reason is true.
Correct Answer: A
Solution :
            Resistance of 50 W bulb is two times the resistance of 100 W bulb. When bulbs are connected in series, 50 W bulb will glow more as (current remains same in series). In parallel the 100 W bulb will glow more as (potential difference remain same in parallel).

D)             If the assertion and reason both are false.
E)             If assertion is false but reason is true.
Correct Answer: D
Solution :
            When two bulbs are connected in series, the resistance of the circuit increases and so the voltage in each decreases, hence the brightness and the temperature also decreases. Due to decrease in temperature, the resistance of the carbon filament will slightly increase while that of metal filament will decrease. Hence, carbon filament bulb will glow more brightly
Also carbon is not a semiconductor.

E)             If assertion is false but reason is true.
Correct Answer: E
Solution :
                Voltage of dc source is constant but in ac, peak value of voltage is

D)             If the assertion and reason both are false.
E)             If assertion is false but reason is true.
Correct Answer: A
Solution :
            When cold water is poured on half portion of the wire, its resistance decreases due to decrease in temperature. As a result of this total resistance of circuit decreases i.e. current through each portion of wire increases i.e. rest of the half portion becomes still more hot.

E)             If assertion is false but reason is true.
Correct Answer: A
Solution :
            As filament of bulb and line wire are in series, hence current through both is same. Now, because
and resistance of the filament of the bulb is much higher than that of line wires, hence heat produced in the filament is much higher than that in line wires.
