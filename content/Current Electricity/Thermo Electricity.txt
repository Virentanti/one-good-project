If the emf of a thermocouple, one junction of which is kept 0°C is given by
then the neutral temperature will be                                                [J & K CET 2005]
A)            a/b
B)            ? a/b
C)            a/2b                                        
D)            ?1/ ab
Correct Answer: B
Solution :
           At neutral temperature, thermal emf will be maximum.
