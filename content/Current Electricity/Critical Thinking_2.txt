C)            90\,\Omega                  
D)            270\,\Omega
Correct Answer: A
Solution :
                   Initially : Resistance of given cable R=\rho \frac{l}{\pi \times {{(9\times {{10}^{-3}})}^{2}}}                                       ... (i) Finally : Resistance of each insulated copper wire is R\,'=\rho \frac{l}{\pi \times {{(3\times {{10}^{-3}})}^{2}}}. Hence equivalent resistance of cable {{R}_{eq}}=\frac{R\,'}{6}=\frac{1}{6}\times \left( \rho \frac{l}{\pi \times {{(3\times {{10}^{-3}})}^{2}}} \right)?.(ii) On solving equation (i) and (ii) we get Req = 7.5 W

A number N of similar cells is now connected in series with a wire of the same material and cross?section but of length 2 L.  The temperature of the wire is raised by the same amount \Delta T in the same time t.  the value of N is                                                                            [IIT-JEE (Screening) 2001]

Correct Answer: B
Solution :
                   Let R and m be the resistance and mass of the first wire, then the second wire has resistance 2R and mass 2m. Let E = emf of each cell, S = specific heat capacity of the material of the wire. For the first wire, current {{i}_{1}}=\frac{3E}{R} and i_{1}^{2}Rt=mS\Delta T For the second wire, {{i}_{2}}=\frac{NE}{2R} and i_{2}^{2}(2R)t=2mS\Delta T. Thus, {{i}_{1}}={{i}_{2}} or N=6.

  The reading of the ideal voltmeter in the adjoining diagram will be
A)            4 V
B)            8 V
C)            12 V
D)            14 V
Correct Answer: B
Solution :
           Current flowing in the circuit i=\frac{E}{R}=\frac{10-4}{20+10}=\frac{1}{5}A P.D. across AC =\frac{1}{5}\times 20=4V P.D. across AN = 4 + 4 = 8V

The resistance of the series combination of two resistance is S. When they are joined in parallel the total resistance is P. If S = nP, then the minimum possible value of n is  [AIEEE 2004]
A)            4    
B)            3
C)            2    
D)            1
Correct Answer: A
Solution :
           If two resistances are {{R}_{1}} and {{R}_{2}} then                    S={{R}_{1}}+{{R}_{2}} and P=\frac{{{R}_{1}}{{R}_{2}}}{({{R}_{1}}+{{R}_{2}})} From given condition S = nP i.e.  ({{R}_{1}}+{{R}_{2}})=n\,\left( \frac{{{R}_{1}}{{R}_{2}}}{{{R}_{1}}+{{R}_{2}}} \right) Þ{{({{R}_{1}}+{{R}_{2}})}^{2}}=n\,\,{{R}_{1}}{{R}_{2}}Þ{{({{R}_{1}}-{{R}_{2}})}^{2}}+4{{R}_{1}}{{R}_{2}}=n{{R}_{1}}{{R}_{2}} So n=4+\frac{{{({{R}_{1}}-{{R}_{2}})}^{2}}}{{{R}_{1}}{{R}_{2}}}. Hence minimum value of n is 4.

A moving coil galvanometer has 150 equal divisions. Its current sensitivity is 10 divisions per milliampere and voltage sensitivity is 2 divisions per millivolt. In order that each division reads 1 volt, the resistance in ohms needed to be connected in series with the coil will be               [AIEEE 2005]
A)            99995                                      
B)            9995
C)            {{10}^{3}}                       
D)            {{10}^{5}}
Correct Answer: B
Solution :
                   Voltage sensitivity =\frac{\text{Current sensitivity}}{\text{Resistance of galvanometer}\,\text{G}} Þ G=\frac{10}{2}=5\,\Omega . Here {{i}_{g}}= Full scale deflection current =\frac{150}{10}=15\,mA. V = Voltage to be measured = 150 ´ 1 = 150 V. Hence R=\frac{V}{{{i}_{g}}}-G=\frac{150}{15\times {{10}^{-3}}}-5=9995\,\Omega .
