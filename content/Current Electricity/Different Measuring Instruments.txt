In Meter Bridge or Wheatstone bridge for measurement of resistance, the known and the unknown resistances are interchanged. The error so removed is [MNR 1988; MP PET 1995]
A)                                                      End correction
B)                    Index error
C)                    Due to temperature effect
D)                    Random error
Correct Answer: A
Solution :
             In meter bridge experiment, it is assumed that the resistance of the L shaped plate is negligible, but actually it is not so. The error created due to this is called, end error. To remove this the resistance box and the unknown resistance must be interchanged and then the mean reading must be taken.
