Assertion             :       The resistivity of a semiconductor increases with temperature. Reason                 :   The atoms of a semiconductor vibrate with larger amplitude at higher temperatures thereby increasing its resistivity                                          [AIIMS 2003]
A)             If both assertion and reason are true and the reason is the correct explanation of the assertion.
B)             If both assertion and reason are true but reason is not the correct explanation of the assertion.
C)             If assertion is true but reason is false.
D)             If the assertion and reason both are false.
E)             If assertion is false but reason is true.
Correct Answer: D
Solution :
            Resistivity of a semiconductor decreases with the temperature. The atoms of a semiconductor vibrate with larger amplitudes at higher temperatures thereby increasing it's conductivity not resistivity.

D)             If the assertion and reason both are false.
E)             If assertion is false but reason is true.
Correct Answer: B
Solution :
                   The temperature co-efficient of resistance for metal is positive and that for semiconductor is negative. In metals free electrons (negative charge) are charge carriers while in P-type semiconductors, holes (positive charge) are majority charge carriers.

D)             If the assertion and reason both are false.
E)             If assertion is false but reason is true.
Correct Answer: A
Solution :
            It is clear that electrons move in all directions haphazardly in metals. When an electric field is applied, each free electron acquire a drift velocity. There is a net flow of charge, which constitute current. In the absence of electric field this is impossible and hence, there is no current.

D)             If the assertion and reason both are false.
E)             If assertion is false but reason is true.
Correct Answer: C
Solution :
            The metallic body of the electrical appliances is connected to the third pin which is connected to the earth. This is a safety precaution and avoids eventual electric shock. By doing this the extra charge flowing through the metallic body is passed to earth and avoid shocks. There is nothing such as reducing of the heating of connecting wires by three pin connections.

Assertion             :       The drift velocity of electrons in a metallic wire will decrease, if the temperature of the wire is increased. Reason                 :   On increasing temperature, conductivity of metallic wire decreases.
A)             If both assertion and reason are true and the reason is the correct explanation of the assertion.

D)             If the assertion and reason both are false.
E)             If assertion is false but reason is true.
Correct Answer: B
Solution :
            On increasing temperature of wire the kinetic energy of free electrons increase and so they collide more rapidly with each other and hence their drift velocity decreases. Also when temperature increases, resistivity increase and resistivity is inversely proportional to conductivity of material.

D)             If the assertion and reason both are false.
E)             If assertion is false but reason is true.
Correct Answer: C
Solution :
            In a conductor there are large number of free electrons. When we close the circuit, the electric field is established instantly with the speed of electromagnetic wave which cause electron drift at every portion of the circuit. Due to which the current is set up in the entire circuit instantly. The current which is set up does not wait for the electrons flow from one end of the conductor to the another end. It is due to this reason, the electric bulb glows immediately when switch is on.

E)             If assertion is false but reason is true.
Correct Answer: A
Solution :
            Resistance wire R=\rho \frac{l}{A}. where r is resistivity of material which does not depend on the geometry of wire. Since when wire is banded, resistivity, length and area of cross-section do not change, therefore resistance of wire also remain same.

Correct Answer: A
Solution :
            Voltameter measures current indirectly in terms of mass of ions deposited and electrochemical equivalent  of the substance \left( I=\frac{m}{Zt} \right). Since value of m and Z are measured to 3rd decimal place and 5th decimal place respectively.

The actual reason is that a current of the order of 0.05 A or even less is enough to bring disorder in our nervous system. As a result of it, the affected person may lose temporarily his ability to exercise his nervous control to get himself free from the high power line.
