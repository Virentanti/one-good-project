The two bulbs as in the above question are connected in series to a 200 volt line. Then                                  [NCERT 1971, 78]
A)            The potential drop across the two bulbs is the same
B)            The potential drop across the 40 watt bulb is greater than the potential drop across the 100 watt bulb
C)            The potential drop across the 100 W bulb is greater than the potential drop across the 40 W bulb
D)            The potential drop across both the bulb is 200 volt
Correct Answer: B
Solution :
           When two bulbs are connected in series, the current will be same in both the bulbs. As a result potential drop will be more in the bulb of higher resistance i.e., bulb of lower wattage.
